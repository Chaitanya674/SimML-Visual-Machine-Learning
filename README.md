## Introduction
Welcome to the Neural Network Visualization project! This project aims to provide a visual representation of a neural network's behavior as it controls a self-driving car. You will be able to see how the neural network processes input data, makes decisions, and steers the car to avoid obstacles and boundaries.

## Project Overview
This project is built using pure JavaScript without any external libraries. It combines graphics and interactive elements to create a visual simulation of a self-driving car equipped with sensors. The car's neural network processes sensor data to make control decisions, and you can observe the car's behavior in real-time.

### Features:
- A self-driving car with simulated sensors.
- A neural network that processes sensor data.
- Real-time visualization of the car's movements and neural network activations.
- Boundary detection and obstacle avoidance.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. There are no additional dependencies or libraries required.

## Getting Started

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chaitanya674/SimML-Visual-Machine-Learning.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can do this by simply double-clicking the file or by opening it using your browser's "Open File" option.

### Interacting with the Simulation
- The self-driving car will start moving automatically.
- The simulation provides a visual representation of the car's movements, sensor data, and neural network activations.
- You can observe how the neural network adjusts the car's steering to avoid boundaries and obstacles.

## Understanding the Code
This project is designed to be educational and provides insights into how a neural network can be applied to control a self-driving car. To understand the code and the neural network logic, you can explore the following files and folders:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the simulation.
- `style.css`: Contains styles for the visual elements.
- `main.js`: The main JavaScript file that initializes the simulation.
- `network.js`: Contains the neural network implementation, including forward propagation and activation functions.
- `car.js`: Represents the self-driving car, its sensors, and the logic for control decisions.
- `sensor.js`: Handles sensor data and interactions.
- `controls.js`: Manages user interface controls.
- `visualizer.js`: Provides visualization and rendering functions.
- `utils.js`: Utility functions for various tasks.
- `road.js`: Represents the road and boundary logic.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and experiment with different neural network configurations to better understand how they work.
